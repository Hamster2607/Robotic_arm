## 3-DOF Robotic Arm: Inverse Kinematics Controller

This project implements a 3-Degree of Freedom (3-DOF) robotic arm control system using an Arduino. 
The firmware translates Cartesian coordinates (X,Y) into joint angles using Inverse Kinematics (IK), allowing the arm to point or reach specific locations on a flat surface.

## Wiring

Servo	       Arduino Pin
Base	       Pin 10
Shoulder	   Pin 9
Elbow	       Pin 11

## A sad story

I'm really dissapointed in myself for not finishing this. It doesn t really work and I just can t figure out why the Inverse Kinematics sometimes works, and sometimes not. If you find the problem in my code please make a pull request or an issue to let me know. I just can t try anymore to figure it out, but maybe i ll come back to it sometime.
